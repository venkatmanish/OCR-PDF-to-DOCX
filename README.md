# OCR-PDF-to-DOCX
A Python project that allows you to extract paragraphs from PDF files using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Leveraging popular libraries such as pytesseract, pdf2image, and python-docx, this project facilitates the conversion of PDFs into images, performing OCR on the images, and generating a DOCX file containing the extracted paragraphs.
